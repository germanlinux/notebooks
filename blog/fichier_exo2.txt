Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit suite
Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Une histoire de poursuite
Flat is better than nested suite
Sparse is better than dense suite
Readability counts
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity
Errors should never pass silently suite
Unless explicitly silenced
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
